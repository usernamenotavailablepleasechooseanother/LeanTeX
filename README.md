# LeanTeX - LaTeX presentations in Lean 4 

Want to make cool presentations in LaTeX? Want macros and
extensibility without having to learn TeX?

## Usage

LeanTeX is made as easy as possible to use!

Create a new Lean project requiring `LeanTeX` in your `lakefile.toml`:
```toml
# This is your presentation root
[[lean_lib]]
name = "MyPresentation"

# Require LeanTex!
[[require]]
name = "LeanTex"
git = "https://github.com/kiranandcode/leantex.git"
```

If you are using a `lakefile.lean`:
```lean
-- lakefile.lean
package MyPresentation

-- This is your presentation root
lean_lib MyPresentation where

-- Require LeanTex!
require LeanTeX from git "https://github.com/kiranandcode/leantex.git" @ "main"
```

In your Lean project, you can import `LeanTeX` use its DSL to write LaTex directly from Lean:
```lean
-- MyPresentation.lean
import LeanTeX

#usepackage bera
#usepackage hyper

#latex_slide do
     latex![| \titlepage |]

```

Finally, to build the presentation, run `lake exe GenerateSlides`:
```bash
$ lake exe GenerateSlides
...

Output written on slides.pdf (5 pages, 33772 bytes).
Transcript written on slides.log.
```
The resulting presentation PDF will be placed in `build/slides.pdf`

## Features

- *Escape hatch* - `latex![| |]` acts as an escape hatch for inserting
  arbitrary text into the generated file. 
  ```lean
  latex![| \author{[|fontsize (size:=18) "Kiran (She/Her)" |]} |]
  ```
  
  The macro itself is an interpolated string, but unlike Lean's
  default string interpolation, we use `[| |]` to break out back into
  Lean. `@{}` also is allowed to escape back into Lean.

- *DSL for Slides* - LeanTex comes with a built in DSL for simplifying
  some LaTeX constructions within Lean:
  ```
  slide "Example Slide" do
     \begin{itemize}
        \item{"Writing LaTeX-like code within Lean"}
        \item{"Looks like LaTeX"}
        \item{"is actually Lean~"}
     \end{itemize}
  ```

- *Animations* - the `with steps` macro allows named steps for your
  animations, avoiding the issue with hard to grasp numeric animation indices

```lean
  with steps [step1, step2, step3, step4] do
     latex![|
       \begin{tikzpicture}
          \draw<@{step1}->  (0,0) rectangle ++(1,1);
          \draw<@{step2}->  (1,0) rectangle ++(1,1);
          \draw<@{step3}->  (2,0) rectangle ++(1,1);
          \draw<@{step4}->  (3,0) rectangle ++(1,1);
       \end{tikzpicture}
     |]
```

- *Static files* - If you create a directory `static` you can place
  files that should be copied into the build directory

See `example` for an example of a LeanTeX project.
